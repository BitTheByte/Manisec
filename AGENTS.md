# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/main/java/com/manifestsecurity/`: Java sources for the Jadx GUI plugin (scanner logic, UI, models).
- `src/main/resources/`: plugin metadata and services registration (e.g., `META-INF/services/jadx.api.plugins.JadxPlugin`).
- `pom.xml`: Maven build configuration and dependencies.
- `target/`: build output (generated by Maven).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `mvn -DskipTests package`: Build the plugin JAR without tests. Output: `target/manisec-<version>.jar`.
- `mvn package`: Standard build; use once tests are added.
- `mvn -q -DskipTests package`: Quiet build for CI logs.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Java 8 source/target (see `pom.xml`).
- Indentation: 4 spaces; no tabs.
- Naming: `PascalCase` for classes (e.g., `ManifestSecurityScanner`), `camelCase` for methods/fields, `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
- Packages follow reverse-domain style: `com.manifestsecurity.*`.

## Testing Guidelines
- No automated test framework is configured yet.
- If adding tests, place them under `src/test/java` and name classes `*Test` (e.g., `ManifestSecurityScannerTest`).
- Prefer JUnit 5 for new tests unless project requirements change.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- No Git history is available in this workspace. Use concise, imperative commit messages (e.g., `Add exported component checks`).
- PRs should include: a clear description, build instructions if changed, and screenshots for UI updates (e.g., report window changes).

## Security & Configuration Tips
- This plugin analyzes `AndroidManifest.xml` for security-relevant signals; keep new checks fast and deterministic.
- When adding new findings, update both the scanner and UI rendering to keep results aligned.
